## Contributing to Transit Network

Thanks for being here! Our project has grown out of a regional hackathon and is now part of Chi Hack Night, a weekly civic tech meeting. 

...but enough about our history. If you're ready to get started with the project, read on!

## Below are Some Short Links to Important Resources:
* The contributing guidelines document. Oh, hey, you're already here!
* Project Slack and discussion channels. These are WIP and require some discussion on our end before we figure this out completely, so we have no links here yet. Check back very soon.
* docs: We are currently working on creating a contributors guide, but in the mean time, please refer to the 
README.md and the Wiki for any questions you may have about contributing
* Bugs can be reported through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vkoves/Transit-Network/issues).
* Wiki: Hey, look at that, we have one of those too! As of this document's construction, it's pretty vacant, but don't be shy. A lot of this project is still in concept development alongside of actual feature production, so start a conversation [here](https://github.com/rjaltman/Transit-Network/wiki).
* GTFS Primer: This project heavily relies on the General Transit Feed Specification, originally developed by Google but now widely supported by various agencies. If you are unfamiliar with formatting of GTFS packages and what the project was in general, check out [Google's documentation on the matter](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/).
* Chicago Transit Authority: This project was born in Illinois and mostly lives in Chicago, so many of our testers and contributors are using [CTA GTFS data](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/gtfs.aspx). If you want to figure out what duplicate stop they're talking about, or any references that seem assumed, we recommend [reviewing the lines as well](http://www.transitchicago.com/travel_information/maps/default.aspx?source_quicklinks=1).

## Submitting and Requesting Changes 

If you have something fresh to throw in the project, but don't feel like contributing directly, feel free to fork this repository. We do ask that, both for central contributors to the project and those who work on the fringes of it, that most sets of modifications are submitted through _pull requests_. Here's what you should do. 
* Create a sparkling new copy or branch just for your emendations.
* Monitor discussion and use best judgment to participate in ongoing issues, which may involve your solution.
* When all done, send it over by opening a pull request:
  * Give a general summary of everything 

_Create a pull request and then create a post on the wiki that explains what the pull request includes along with a link to the pull request_ 

## Bug Reports and Issues

We use the GitHub Issues platform tied into this repository to manage most feature and issue discussions. If you found something that went haywire, have suggestions, or need help, go there first.

* Templates: 
  * What is wrong:
  * Exact steps to recreate bug (if possible):
  * Error Log:

  * Edit framework to accomodate different data sets from other transit centers
    
## New Feature Requirements
* New Features must stay within the spirit of the original project: making transportation bettter
* Submit new feature requests on the wiki and the community can discuss them
* Features deamed needed will be used to create issues and milestones

## Style Guide / Coding conventions 
We utilize the Airbnb style guide. Specifics about the style can be found [here](http://airbnb.io/projects/styleguides/)

## Code of Conduct
This is a constructive environment. No discrimination against any members of this team and community will be tollerated here.

## Recognition model
All contributors who's pull requests are merged can ask to 
put in the CONTRIBUTERS.md file in order to be recognized

## Where can I ask for help?
The wiki is specifically there to encourage discussion among community members. If you have any problems that Google can't solve, feel free to post them on the wiki.
